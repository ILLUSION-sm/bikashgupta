# Flutter Portfolio Website

A modern portfolio website built with Flutter Web, 

## Setup Instructions

Since the project files were generated manually, you need to initialize the Flutter platform scaffolding (web, android, ios, etc.).

1.  **Initialize Flutter Project**:
    Run the following command in the project root:
    ```bash
    flutter create . --platforms=web
    ```
    This will generate the `web/` directory and other platform-specific files without overwriting the existing `lib/` code.

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the App**:
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
